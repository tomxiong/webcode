### Decision Record
[2025-07-27 01:55:07] - Server port management and testing workflow - Always close running servers after testing to avoid port conflicts

**Decision Background:**
During development and testing of the Expert Rules Engine, we encountered multiple instances where the server failed to start due to port 3000 being already in use. This happened because previous development servers were left running in background terminals, causing EADDRINUSE errors and preventing new server instances from starting properly.

**Available Options:**
- Option 1: Use different ports for different testing scenarios
  - Pros: Avoids conflicts, allows multiple servers
  - Cons: Complicates configuration, harder to remember ports
- Option 2: Always terminate existing servers before starting new ones
  - Pros: Clean environment, consistent port usage, prevents conflicts
  - Cons: Requires manual intervention, may interrupt ongoing work

**Final Decision:**
Always terminate existing servers before starting new ones, and establish a workflow to close servers after testing completion.

**Implementation Plan:**
- Step 1: Check for running processes on port 3000 before starting server
- Step 2: Terminate existing processes if found
- Step 3: Start new server instance
- Step 4: Close server after testing completion
- Validation Method: Verify no EADDRINUSE errors occur during server startup

**Risks and Mitigation:**
- Risk 1: Accidentally terminating important processes → Mitigation: Check process details before termination
- Risk 2: Forgetting to close servers → Mitigation: Include server closure in testing workflow documentation
